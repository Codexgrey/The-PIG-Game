# The PIG Game
* This is a game i built as part of my learning path in JavaScript. I watched and coded along as Jonas Schmedtmann built the game in his course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019". I gained understanding on several important Javascript concepts by doing so;

1. The DOM and DOM manipulation
2. Events and Event Handling
3. How Events are processed in the Execution stack
4. Callback function, anonymous function
5. Ternary Operator
6. Add, remove and toggle HTML Classes
7. Using functions to correctly apply the dry principle
8. Logical thinking as a programmer.
9. State Variable

# GAME RULES
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

ENJOY...
